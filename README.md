# clink-themes
A site for sharing Clink color themes and custom prompts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Custom prompts shared in this repo are contributed by users of Clink.  They may not have been tested thoroughly, and using them on a different computer than the author's computer might reveal unexpected problems.  If you find problems, open an issue in this repo -- or if there's a link to a separate repo for the custom prompt then open an issue in its separate repo.
>
> As with any software, decide whether you trust the author of a custom prompt before trying to use the custom prompt.  That should go without saying for all software -- but I'm calling it out here because it might not be obvious that custom prompts are software just like any other software, and could have unexpected effects.
