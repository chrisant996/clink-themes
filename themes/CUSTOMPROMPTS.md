# Custom Prompts

<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE --- Copy the following and fill it in ---

## Your Custom Prompt Name

Describe your custom prompt.

Give a link to the custom prompt you've added -- be sure to make it a relative link, e.g. [My Prompt](#my_prompt.clinkprompt).

Optionally include a link to a separate main repo for the custom prompt, if you have one.

Recommended:  Add a screen shot of the custom prompt, for example after running `clink config prompt show YourCustomPrompt`.
