# Color Themes

<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE --- Copy the following and fill it in ---

## Your Color Theme Name

Describe your color theme.

Give a link to the color theme you've added -- be sure to make it a relative link, e.g. [My Theme](#my_theme.clinktheme).

Optionally include a link to a separate main repo for the color theme, if you have one.

Recommended:  Add a screen shot of the color theme, for example after running `clink config theme show YourColorTheme`.
